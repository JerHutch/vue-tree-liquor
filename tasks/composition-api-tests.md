# Composition API Tests Implementation Plan

## Problem Description

The LiquorTree library is being migrated from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Components and composables that have been converted to use the Composition API need comprehensive test coverage to ensure:

1. Proper functionality during the migration
2. Regression prevention for future changes
3. Documentation of expected behavior through tests

## Current Composition API Usage Analysis

From initial codebase analysis, the following files use Composition API:

### Composables
- `src/composables/useDragAndDrop.js` - Vue 3 composable for drag and drop functionality

### Components with Composition API Elements
- Components may have mixed usage of Options API and Composition API features
- Need to identify specific Composition API usage in Vue components

## Proposed Solution Approach

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup
- Ensure Vitest is properly configured for Vue 3 component testing
- Set up Vue Test Utils for component testing
- Create test directory structure matching src structure

### 2. Composable Testing Strategy
- **useDragAndDrop composable**: Test all reactive state, computed properties, and methods
- Test composable in isolation and with mock DOM elements
- Test drag and drop event handling and state transitions

### 3. Component Testing Strategy
- Test components that use Composition API features
- Focus on props, emits, and reactive behavior
- Test component integration with composables

## Key Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure
1. ✅ Create git branch `feature/composition-api-tests`
2. ✅ Create this planning document
3. Verify test setup and dependencies
4. Create test directory structure

### Phase 2: Composable Testing
1. Analyze `useDragAndDrop.js` implementation
2. Create comprehensive tests for the composable:
   - Test reactive state management
   - Test drag event handlers
   - Test drop validation logic
   - Test cleanup and lifecycle

### Phase 3: Component Testing
1. Identify components using Composition API
2. Create tests for each component focusing on:
   - Composition API features specifically
   - Integration with composables
   - Props and emit behavior
   - Reactive state changes

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
1. Test component-composable integration
2. Test drag and drop functionality end-to-end
3. Verify Vue 3 specific features work correctly

## Testing Strategy

### Tools and Framework
- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework (already configured)
- **@vue/test-utils**: Vue 3 component testing utilities
- **jsdom**: DOM simulation for drag/drop testing

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (Composables)
- Test each composable function in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

#### Component Tests
- Mount components with Vue Test Utils
- Test props, events, and slots
- Test reactive behavior and state changes

#### Integration Tests
- Test component-composable interactions
- Test complex user interactions (drag and drop sequences)
- Test with realistic data scenarios

### Coverage Goals
- 100% line coverage for new Composition API code
- All public methods and reactive properties tested
- Edge cases and error conditions covered

## Success Criteria

1. All Composition API composables have comprehensive unit tests
2. Components using Composition API features have focused tests
3. Test suite runs successfully with `npm run test`
4. Tests serve as documentation for expected behavior
5. Code coverage meets quality standards

## Risk Mitigation

- **DOM Dependencies**: Use jsdom and careful mocking for drag/drop testing
- **Vue 3 Migration Issues**: Test both new and legacy behavior where applicable
- **Test Maintenance**: Write clear, focused tests that are easy to maintain

## Next Steps

1. Complete infrastructure setup
2. Begin with useDragAndDrop composable testing
3. Identify and test Vue components with Composition API usage
4. Create integration tests for complete workflows
